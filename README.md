# Summary

UD_Ancient_Greek-PROIEL is converted from the Ancient Greek data in the PROIEL treebank, and consists of the New Testament plus selections from Herodotus.

# Introduction

The Ancient Greek PROIEL treebank is based on the Ancient Greek data from the PROIEL treebank, which is maintained at the Department of Philosophy, Classics, History of Arts and Ideas at the University of Oslo. The conversion is based on the 20180408 release of the PROIEL treebank available from https://github.com/proiel/proiel-treebank/releases. The original annotators are acknowledged in the files available there. The conversion code is available in the Rubygem proiel-cli, https://github.com/proiel/proiel-cli.

The treebank contains most of the New Testament plus selections from Herodotus' Histories. The original annotation guidelines are available at http://folk.uio.no/daghaug/syntactic_guidelines.pdf.
